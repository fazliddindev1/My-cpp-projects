## Easy Projects

### Basic Calculator
A simple console-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Number Guessing Game
It is a game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. The game provides hints like "too high" or "too low" after each guess.

### Student Management System
A console application to manage student records, including adding, deleting, updating, and displaying student information.

## Intermediate Projects

### Library Management System
A system to manage library operations, such as issuing books, returning books, and tracking the availability of books. Uses file handling to store and retrieve data.

### Banking System
A banking system where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view account details. It includes proper error handling and uses classes to represent different entities.

### Inventory Management System
A system to manage a store's inventory, with features like adding new items, updating stock, and generating sales reports. Uses file handling to store inventory data.

## Advanced Projects

### Chat Application
A simple chat application using socket programming. Includes both the client and server sides, allowing multiple clients to connect and chat with each other.

### File Compression and Decompression Tool
A tool to compress and decompress files using algorithms like Huffman coding, demonstrating a good understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### Compiler
A basic compiler for a simple programming language, implementing lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation phases.

### Game Development
Games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake, or a simple 2D platformer using graphics libraries like SDL or SFML, involving graphics, input handling, and game logic.

### Machine Learning Project
An implementation of a machine learning algorithm from scratch, such as linear regression or k-means clustering, using C++ for data processing and algorithm implementation.
